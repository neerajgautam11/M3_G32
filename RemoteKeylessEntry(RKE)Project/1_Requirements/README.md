#  Remote Keyless Entry System 
## Introduction :
A Remote Keyless Entry lock, also known as keyless entry or remote central locking, is one that uses an electronic remote control as a key that is activated by a handheld device or automatically by proximity. An RKS, which is widely used in automobiles, accomplishes the tasks of a traditional car key without requiring physical touch. Pressing a button on the remote while within a few yards of the automobile can lock or unlock the doors, as well as conduct other operations.

Remote keyless entry (RKE) is an electronic access system that can be controlled from a distance. RKEs, which are typically used to remotely lock or unlock doors, require the end user to initiate an action that will cause a physical or software key fob to transmit a radio signal to a receiver that controls an electronic lock. Typically, the action is to press a button on a physical fob or mobile app.

## About :
RKE systems employ encryption methods to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams. RKE systems operate by transmitting radio waves on a certain frequency unidirectionally.

## Objective :
1. When the Button is pressed ONCE, the car must be locked.
2. When the Button is pressed TWICE, the automobile must be opened.
3. When the Button is pressed THREE times, the alarm is activated or deactivated.
4. When the Button is pressed FOUR times, the automobile must be exposed to light.

## Current State of the Art :
 1. The main focus is on wireless and remote control of the car.
2. The second area of focus is to give our car with security via a dependable Encryption System.
3. For the younger generation, a new generation of smart automobile concept.

### Strength
* Optimized power and range.
* Advance security.
### Weakness
* Replacing a lost fob costs much more than a traditional key electronic components wear out over time, which then means replacement of either the key or system repair
### Opportunities
* Allow users to use their smartphones as keys, even controlling extra features like remote start from these handheld devices.
	
### Threats
* Thieves, however, are rising to the challenge, using radio transmitters to perform ‘relay’ car hacks to capture the signal from the car’s fob 
possibility for hackers to manipulate the technology and steal your vehicle.

 ### Who :
 * owner of the vehicle

### What :
* Keyless entry systems are used to remotely lock, unlock and can
have various features.

### When :
* within a range of distance a button is pushed, it sends a coded signal by radio waves to a receiver unit in the car, which locks or unlocks the door And do the task require.
### Why :
* Remote keyless entry systems alarm the vehicle against theft and lock and unlock the doors.
### How :
* Keyless entry to a vehicle is usually attained by sending a radio frequency signal from a remote transmitter to the receiver in the car.
