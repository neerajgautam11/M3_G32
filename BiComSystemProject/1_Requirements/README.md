#  BI-COM SYSTEM
## Introduction :
A bi-com lock, also known as keyless entry or remote central locking, is one that uses an electronic remote control as a key that is activated by a handheld device or automatically by proximity. An RKS, which is widely used in automobiles, accomplishes the tasks of a traditional car key without requiring physical touch. Pressing a button on the remote while within a few yards of the automobile can lock or unlock the doors, as well as conduct other operations.

## About :
RKE systems employ encryption methods to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams. RKE systems operate by transmitting radio waves on a certain frequency unidirectionally.

## Objective :
1. When the Button is pressed ONCE, the car must be locked.
2. When the Button is pressed TWICE, the automobile must be opened.
3. When the Button is pressed THREE times, the alarm is activated or deactivated.
4. When the Button is pressed FOUR times, the automobile must be exposed to light.

## Current State of the Art :
1. The main focus is on wireless and remote control of the car.
2. The second area of focus is to give our car with security via a dependable Encryption System.
3. For the younger generation, a new generation of smart automobile concept.

### Strength
* Optimized power and range.
* Advance security.
### Weakness
* Replacing a lost fob costs much more than a traditional key electronic components wear out over time, which then means replacement of either the key or system repair
### Opportunities
* Allow users to use their smartphones as keys, even controlling extra features like remote start from these handheld devices.
	
### Threats
* Thieves, however, are rising to the challenge, using radio transmitters to perform ‘relay’ car hacks to capture the signal from the car’s fob 
possibility for hackers to manipulate the technology and steal your vehicle.

### WHAT:
* It is a feature which can be used to access your car remotly.

### WHO:
* The owner who has the key can access the car.

### WHEN:
* When the user will press the button on the key, it will open/lock the car.

### Why :
* Remote keyless entry systems alarm the vehicle against theft and lock and unlock the doors.

### HOW:
* By pressing the button on the key we access the car lock.
