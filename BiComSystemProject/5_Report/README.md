# BI-COM System :

 A BiCom system is the extention of the unidirectional RKE to bidirectional RKE system.
 ·      
* Keyfob -> car (like a unidirectional RKE system). 
* car -> keyfob (car status information for displaying on the keyfob by LED or
display).
* RKE transmission requires two components - a transmitter and a receiver. 
* Transmitter - RKE key fob, other ID device with RKE integrated 
* Receiver - Body Control ECU, other ECU with integrated RKE. 
* RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally.

## Introduction :
A bi-com lock, also known as keyless entry or remote central locking, is one that uses an electronic remote control as a key that is activated by a handheld device or automatically by proximity. An RKS, which is widely used in automobiles, accomplishes the tasks of a traditional car key without requiring physical touch. Pressing a button on the remote while within a few yards of the automobile can lock or unlock the doors, as well as conduct other operations.

## Abstract :
RKE systems employ encryption methods to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams. RKE systems operate by transmitting radio waves on a certain frequency unidirectionally.

## Objective :
1. When the Button is pressed ONCE, the car must be locked.
2. When the Button is pressed TWICE, the automobile must be opened.
3. When the Button is pressed THREE times, the alarm is activated or deactivated.
4. When the Button is pressed FOUR times, the automobile must be exposed to light.

## Current State of the Art :
1. The main focus is on wireless and remote control of the car.
2. The second area of focus is to give our car with security via a dependable Encryption System.
3. For the younger generation, a new generation of smart automobile concept.

## Requirements : 
### RKE (Bi-com system)

# High Level Requirements

| ID | High Level Requirements |
| -------- | -------------- |
| HLR1 | WINDOW STATUS OF THE CAR will be printed on it |
| HLR2 | ALARM STATUS OF THE CAR will be printed |
| HLR3 | It will print the CAR BATTERY INFORMATION |
| HLR4 | The DOOR STATUS OF THE CAR will be printed on it |

# Low Level Requirements
| ID         | Low Level Requirements for HLR1   | 
| --------    | ---------------          |  
| LLR1.1      | When you hit the button, all of the LEDs should turn on   | 
| LLR1.2      | All of the LEDs should be turned on at the same time i.e Green-on, Orange-on, Red-on, Blue-on|

| ID         | Low Level Requirements for HLR2   |  
|  --------     |  --------     | 
| LLR2.1        | When you click the button, all of the LEDs should turn off at the same time   |
| LLR2.2      | All the LED's should be turned off at the same time i.e Green-off, Orange-off, Red-off, Blue-off|


| Id          | Low Level Requirements for HLR3   |  
|  --------      |  --------       | 
| LLR3.1        | When the button is pressed all the LED's shall be on    |
| LLR3.2        | When the button is pressed LED's shall be on in clockwise direction | 

| ID          | Low Level Requirements for HLR4   |  
| --------    |  --------      |  
| LLR4.1        | When the button is pressed all the LED's shall be on    | 
| LLR4.2        | When the button is pressed LED's shall be on in anti-clockwise direction |




##  S.W.O.T Analysis :

### Strength
* Optimized power and range.
* Advance security.
### Weakness
* Replacing a lost fob costs much more than a traditional key electronic components wear out over time, which then means replacement of either the key or system repair
### Opportunities
* Allow users to use their smartphones as keys, even controlling extra features like remote start from these handheld devices.
	
### Threats
* Thieves, however, are rising to the challenge, using radio transmitters to perform ‘relay’ car hacks to capture the signal from the car’s fob 
possibility for hackers to manipulate the technology and steal your vehicle.


## 5W's & 1H :

### WHAT:
* It is a feature which can be used to access your car remotly.

### WHO:
* The owner who has the key can access the car.

### WHEN:
* When the user will press the button on the key, it will open/lock the car.

### Why :
* Remote keyless entry systems alarm the vehicle against theft and lock and unlock the doors.

### HOW:
* By pressing the button on the key we access the car lock.
