## Aim :
* To design a RKE system.
* To design a Bi-com system.

## Introduction :
#### Remote keyless entry (RKE) system & BiCom system:

The term remote keyless system (RKS), also called keyless entry or remote central locking, refers to a lock that uses an electronic remote control as a key which is activated by a handheld device or automatically by proximity.
Widely used in automobiles, an RKS performs the functions of a standard car key without physical contact. When within a few yards of the car, pressing a button on the remote can lock or unlock the doors, and may perform other functions.

#### While Bicom system is the extention of the unidirectional RKE to bidirectional RKE system:
* RKE transmission requires two components - a transmitter and a receiver. 
* Transmitter - RKE key fob, other ID device with RKE integrated 
* Receiver - Body Control ECU, other ECU with integrated RKE 
* RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally.
